RFP suggestions: 
Database vendor will implement, test, and validate data from multiple sources (internal sources and external sources) with minimal to no supervision. Vendor will work directly with organizations which own data exports to ensure accuracy and timeliness for data to be imported into the database. 

Database vendor will offer expertise on data quality, recommendations for methods to improve data quality, and implementation for improvements (matching improvements, consolidation improvement, splits, etc.). This would also include an active response to any customer care issues, and the vendor would be take ownership of resolving identification issues from customer care (identify the issue, offer solutions, implement solutions, and validate the implementation was successful).

Database vendor would have ownership of ensuring data accuracy utilizing regular checks and validation techniques. If there are issues with data accuracy (missing files or process related issues), the vendor would have in house the expertise needed to correct processes. If issues arise then the database vendor will communicate what issues there are with the data and an ETA for it to be corrected.

Database vendor will have expertise on identifying online traffic, and the ability to work closely with coremetrics to get a higher "match rate" (# of identified customers/overall traffic) using numerous sources (email traffic, ad traffic, etc.).
