Changes, assuming we begin with similar structure as exists now:

-Ecom transactions seamlessly integrated with t log
-Reliable GM for every sku in every transaction (ecom and store)
-Direct mail: coupon upc codes tied to campaigns (with CA/US flag)
-Clicks tied to email
-Add dates:
  -First sign-up for loyalty
  -First sign-up for email program
  -First opt-out of email, last opt-out of email
